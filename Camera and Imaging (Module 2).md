## Pinhole and Perspective Projections

>You cannot see an image being formed because the screen receives light from a lot of different points, creating overlapping of light rays, making it impossible to see a clear image being formed.

- *"...z-axis points toward the image plane and lies on the optical axis..."*
  *Optical axis:* axis perpendicular to the image plane

*Effective focal length*: The distance between the pinhole and the image plane

>Two triangles are **similar** if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are **proportional**. We can think of one similar triangle as an enlargement or a reduction of the other. (See [Similar Triangles](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Trigonometry_(Yoshiwara)/01%3A_Triangles_and_Circles/1.01%3A_Similar_Triangles)).
> Because they are proportional we can derive the following formula:
> $$ \frac{a}{a'} = \frac{b}{b'} = \frac{c}{c'}$$
