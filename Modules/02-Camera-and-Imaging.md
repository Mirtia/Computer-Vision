## Pinhole and Perspective Projections

>You cannot see an image being formed because the screen receives light from a lot of different points, creating overlapping of light rays, making it impossible to see a clear image being formed.

- *"...z-axis points toward the image plane and lies on the optical axis..."*
  *Optical axis:* axis perpendicular to the image plane

*Effective focal length*: The distance between the pinhole and the image plane

>Two triangles are **similar** if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are **proportional**. We can think of one similar triangle as an enlargement or a reduction of the other. (See [Similar Triangles](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Precalculus/Trigonometry_(Yoshiwara)/01%3A_Triangles_and_Circles/1.01%3A_Similar_Triangles)).
> Because they are proportional we can derive the following formula:
> $$ \frac{a}{a'} = \frac{b}{b'} = \frac{c}{c'}$$

### Image Magnification

Applying Perspective Projection:

...
$$ 
|m| = |\frac{f}{z_0}|
$$
Image size inversely proportional to depth  

### Visualizing the Effect

Imagine a pinhole camera capturing an image of a tall building. If the screen is 2 meters behind the pinhole, you get a smaller but possibly brighter and sharper image. Moving the screen to 4 meters increases the image size, showing more detail of the building but potentially reducing sharpness and brightness, requiring adjustments in exposure time.

### Finding the Vanishing Point

### Ideal Pinhole Size

![[PInhole-Camera-Size.png]]

Ideal size of the pinhole:
$$d\approx 2\cdot \sqrt{f \cdot λ}$$
f: effective focal length
λ: wavelength

- Pinhole cameras require long exposures to capture bright images
